# TimeSeriesForecasting-torch

Notice: 

This repository is deprecated, an updated version has been provided in [Univ-Forecasting](https://github.com/Analytics-for-Forecasting/UniV-Forecasting).


## DeepAR-torch

This is a pytorch-based modification of DeepAR ([DeepAR: Probabilistic Forecasting with Autoregressive Recurrent Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110)).

Based on the works of [TimeSeries](https://github.com/zhykoties/TimeSeries), this implementation is developed to provide more easy-reading API for training and testing single variable as well as multi-variable time sries.

## ConvRNN

This is a pytorch-based modification of ConvRNN([Autoregressive Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network for Univariate and Multivariate Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02540))

## MSVR

This is a numpy-based Multiple-output support vector regression which implements support vector regression with multi-input and multi-output. This package is based on our group's paper [Multi-step-ahead time series prediction using multiple-output support vector regression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S092523121300917X).
The details of usage can be found in [MSVR](https://github.com/Analytics-for-Forecasting/msvr).
